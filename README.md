# Health Bridge - Health Information Management System

Health Bridge is a simple, full-stack Health Information Management System designed for clinics and doctors to register clients, manage their health records, and enroll them into health programs. The system also provides secure JWT-based login functionality for doctors.

## Features
-Doctor login using email and password

-Secure backend with JWT token-based authentication

-Register new clients and view all registered clients

-Edit and delete client records

-Add new health programs and assign them to clients

## Technologies Used
### Frontend:

-React

-React Router DOM

-Axios

-React Toastify

### Backend:

-Node.js

-Express.js

-JSON Web Token (JWT)

-dotenv

-File system for data storage (clients.json, programs.json)

## To install and run the project locally, start by cloning the repository with:

git clone https://github.com/Elsiewangui/health-bridge.git  

cd health-bridge  

### Install the frontend dependencies: 
 
npm install  

Then move into the backend directory to install server dependencies:  

cd server  

npm install  

Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` folder and add the following:  

SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key  

### Start the backend server:  
node server.js  

Go back to the root folder and run the React frontend:  

cd ..  

npm start  

Once everything is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## API Routes
The application includes the following API endpoints:

-POST /login – Doctor login, returns JWT token  

-GET /clients – Get all clients (protected route) 

-GET /clients/:id – Get a specific client by ID 

-POST /clients – Add a new client  

-PUT /clients/:id – Update an existing client  

-DELETE /clients/:id – Delete a client  

-GET /programs – Retrieve all health programs  

-POST /programs – Add a new health program  

## Authentication

Authentication is handled using JWT. On successful login, a JWT token is generated by the backend and returned to the client. This token is stored in localStorage and is included in the Authorization header of subsequent requests using the format: `Bearer <token>`. Protected routes on the backend validate the token before allowing access. The frontend checks for this token to conditionally render protected components such as the navigation bar and dashboard routes.
